					<p>
					In the center of the page, there is a list of different
					mechanisms which sites can use for detecting focus. They
					turn <span class="text-color-red">red</span> when that
					mechanism has detected a loss of focus and <span
					class="text-color-green">green</span> when the mechanism
					detects that you are focused on the page.
					</p>
					<p>
					For example, when the <b><i>mouse</i></b> mechanism turns <span
					class="text-color-red">red</span>, the site has detected
					your mouse cursor leaving the page.
					</p>
					<p>
					If any are <span class="text-color-red">red</span>, a site
					could be able to detect that whatever you are doing is
					outside the page. If multiple mechanisms are <span
					class="text-color-red">red</span>, then it's very likely
					that a site could detect a loss of focus.
					</p>
					<p>
					Sites may also use other mechanisms which are not listed
					here. Because of this, even if all the mechanisms in the
					list are <span class="text-color-green">green</span>, a
					site could still detect a loss of focus.
