title: Using Tailscale on the CS servers

It's possible to add the CS servers to your Tailscale network (Tailnet).
However, make sure you still follow the [acceptable use policies][aup] if you
choose to do so. Simply using Tailscale to connect to the servers from
off-campus does not appear to be a violation of the policies (according to my
understanding), but do this at your own risk.

[aup]: https://www.cs.purdue.edu/resources/aup.html

## Setup

To add a server to your Tailnet, you need to run `tailscaled` on the machine. We
can't do this as root, but `tailscaled` has a userspace networking mode in which
it doesn't need root access.

### Install Tailscale binaries

Install `tailscaled` and `tailscale` by downloading the static release binaries
from
[https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/#static](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/#static)
onto the server (e.g. using `curl` or `wget`). Then unpack the downloaded
archive using `tar`. Copy the `tailscaled` and `tailscale` binaries into
`~/.local/bin`. Also add this directory to your `PATH` so you can run the
`tailscale` utility.

<Callout style="note">
    You can put them somewhere else, but you'll need to adjust the service file
    below to have the correct path to the binaries.
</Callout>

### Create the systemd service

To keep the daemon running, we'll use [Systemd], which manages running services
for us.

To create the service definition, run this command:

```sh
systemctl --user edit --full --force tailscaled.service
```

Then write the following into the editor and save the file:

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Tailscale node agent
Documentation=https://tailscale.com/kb/
Wants=network-pre.target
After=network-pre.target
; After=NetworkManager.service systemd-resolved.service

[Service]
ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/tailscaled --statedir=${STATE_DIRECTORY} --socket=${RUNTIME_DIRECTORY}/tailscaled.sock --tun=userspace-networking
ExecStopPost=%h/.local/bin/tailscaled --statedir=${STATE_DIRECTORY} --socket=${RUNTIME_DIRECTORY}/tailscaled.sock --cleanup
Type=notify

Restart=on-failure

# Include hostname in state/cache directories because the filesystem is shared
# across machines.
RuntimeDirectory=tailscaled/%H
StateDirectory=tailscaled/%H
CacheDirectory=tailscaled/%H

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

<Callout style="note">
    This configuration was developed by referencing both the Systemd manual
    pages and the Tailscale documentation. If you have questions about this
    service configuration, please try to reference those to answer your
    question. If you need more explanation, feel free to open an issue
    requesting elaboration and I'll do my best to explain how it works.
</Callout>

<Callout style="important">
    The `--user` option to `systemctl` specifies that we want to interact with
    the `systemd` daemon running as our user account. If you leave that option
    out, `systemctl` will try to control the system daemon, which runs as
    `root`.
</Callout>

### Running the service

To allow the service to stay running after you log out of the machine, we need
to enable lingering units:

```sh
loginctl enable-linger
```

Then we can enable the unit (which tells Systemd to start it automatically).
We'll also pass the `--now` flag to also start it right now instead of waiting
until the next login:

```sh
systemctl --user enable --now tailscaled.service
```

### Shell alias for `tailscale`

Since we're running `tailscaled` as our user and not as root, we're using
a different socket path from the default. The `tailscale` command assumes
`tailscaled` is being run as `root`, and thus that the socket is in the default
system-wide location.

To reconcile this, we must specify the `--socket` option to every invocation of
the `tailscale` command. To make this easier, we can define a shell alias that
does this automatically:

```sh
alias tailscale="tailscale --socket=\${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/tailscaled/$(hostname)/tailscaled.sock"
```

You can place this in your shellrc (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to set this
alias by default every time you log in.

Verify that you've configured everything properly by running `tailscale status`.
It should print `Logged out.`. If instead you get a message like the following,
go back and check your work.

```
failed to connect to local tailscaled (which appears to be running as tailscaled, pid 1772571). Got error: Failed to connect to local Tailscale daemon for /localapi/v0/status; not running? Error: dial unix /some/socket/path: connect: no such file or directory
```

### Connecting to your Tailnet

Now that `tailscaled` is running and `tailscale` can control it, all that's left
to do is connect the daemon to your Tailscale account. Do this by running
`tailscale up` as you normally would. I won't provide specific options to use,
as that can depend on your Tailscale configuration and desired use cases.
