First see this [help page](../help-pages/): [Creating personal homepage][hp].

[hp]: https://www.cs.purdue.edu/resources/facilities/help/Creating-personal-homepage.html

Undergraduate students don't have a "directory page," but you do have a "personal
page."

## WWW server

While your [home directory](../home-symlink/) is on an NFS drive and is mounted
on all of the CS servers, only one of them hosts the web server. At the time of
writing, this is `pythia.cs.purdue.edu`:

```
$ dig +short www.cs.purdue.edu
pythia.cs.purdue.edu.
128.10.19.120
```

## More advanced features

The web server running on pythia.cs is [Apache HTTPd]. It's using [mod_userdir
to serve per-user directories][mod_userdir]. See the _Allowing users to alter
configuration_ section of that page; it mentions that we can use `.htaccess`
files to modify web server configuration for our directory. (The help pages
[also mention this][password].)

For example, you can disable directory listings so clients can access files in
a directory but not list the contents (like removing the read permission from
a UNIX directory):

```apache
# Don't provide directory listings
Options -Indexes
```

See [the tutorial on `.htaccess` files][.htaccess] for more information on what
you can do with these files.

[Apache HTTPd]: https://httpd.apache.org/
[mod_userdir]: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/public_html.html
[.htaccess]: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/htaccess.html
[password]: https://www.cs.purdue.edu/resources/facilities/help/Password-Protected-Directories.html

### Reverse proxy

You can use your personal page as a reverse proxy using a configuration like
this:

```apache
# Enable rewrite rules
RewriteEngine On
# Set the base path that rewrites will match relative to
RewriteBase "/homes/kkasad/"
# Redirect the path to always include a trailing slash
RewriteRule "^forward$" "/homes/kkasad/forward/"
# Reverse proxy to the given site
RewriteRule "^forward/(.*)$" "http://data.cs.purdue.edu:20202/$1" [proxy]
```

This will send requests for `https://cs.purdue.edu/homes/kkasad/forward/XXX` to
to `http://data.cs.purdue.edu:20202/XXX`, where `XXX` is any sub-path.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that the WWW server is running on `pythia.cs`, so you can't use
> loopback addresses like `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. Make sure your upstream
> service is listening on a non-local IP (like `0.0.0.0`).
