The CS department has many printers that students and faculty in the CS
department can use. These are completely separate from ITaP's printers, and they
don't drain your ITaP print quota.

Since these printers don't use ITaP's infrastructure, they act like regular
network printers. You have to add the printer you want to use to your computer's
settings before you can print on it.

Here is the list of CS department printers:

Highlighted in yellow at the top of that page is a link to another page with
instructions on how to actually add a printer to your computer and use it.
