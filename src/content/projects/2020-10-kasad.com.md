kasad.com is a Debian server I’ve been running since 2020. It’s a very low-spec
VPS, but it still hosts my website (the one you’re reading now), plus a variety
of services for my personal use.

The most difficult one to set up by far was the mail server. It requires
configuring SMTP, IMAP, DMARC, SPF, DKIM, DNS, spam filtering, authentication,
mail aliasing/forwarding, and more in order to meet the stringent anti-spam
requirements of other mail servers like Google’s Gmail. I spent several months
learning about the nitty-gritty details of email protocols, and despite the
challenges, I now have my very own self-hosted email server. You can reach me at
[kian@kasad.com]!

I first booted up the kasad.com server in 2020, and I’ve been slowly building it
up ever since. Most recently, I set up metrics collection & exporting, allowing
me to use the Grafana & Prometheus instances on [my other server] to monitor the
kasad.com server.

As this is a long-running project, I’ve written documentation on how the server
is set up—mainly for my own reference, but it has helped a few other people as
well. While the documentation site is not live right now, you can view an
archived version using the link above.
