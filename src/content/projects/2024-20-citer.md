One of the amazing features of Rust is its powerful iterator system. It allows
you to chain transformations on collections of data in a way that is both
efficient and easy to write. I wanted to bring this power to C, so I wrote
CIter.

CIter implements the most important parts of Rust’s iterator system, including
nearly all transformations. It supports double-ended iterators, fixed-size
iterators, and even iterators with known but non-exact size bounds.

This library is one of many smaller open-source projects I’ve worked on. The
main goal was practice for myself, but I also made Citer available to others who
might find it useful. To ensure its quality, I set up a continuous integration
pipeline which tests the code on each commit.
