To learn more about the inner workings of the IPv4 and TCP protocols, I decided
to go about implementing both myself from scratch.

The userspace network stack (“Unet” for short) uses [TAP devices] to bypass the
Linux kernel's handling of network packets. Unet reads the raw IP packets
straight from the kernel and processes them itself. It manages things like
packet fragmentation, reassembly, and (once finished) all aspects of the TCP
protocol, such as retransmission and congestion control. Unet also makes use of
concepts like zero-copy programming (avoiding making copies of data) to ensure
its performance and robustness.

Unet is currently a (slow) work in progress. As of the time of writing this,
I've implemented IPv4 packet reassembly and have begun work on the TCP
implementation.
