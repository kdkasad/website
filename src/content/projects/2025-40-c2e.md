C2E is a program that translates [C] variable/type declarations into English explanations.

C2E comes in two forms: it runs as a CLI program and as a website. Both are powered by a common library containing the core functionality, written in Rust. The library is compiled to [WebAssembly (WASM)][wasm] for the website and runs fully client-side, allowing it to be immediately responsive on every keystroke.
