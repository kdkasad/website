This project is a regular expression engine (a thing that compiles and executes
regular expressions) built completely from scratch. It parses regular expression
patterns, compiles them to [non-deterministic finite state automata][nfa],
converts those to [deterministic finite state automata][dfa], and executes those
to match patterns in text.

The implementation was built using only theory as reference, and without looking
at other existing implementations. This means it's probably not the best design
or most efficient implementation possible, but it made for a fun challenge.

I also shared what I learned in [a presentation] delivered at a [Purdue Hackers]
event, called _Hack Night_.
